We can observe the following for a holistic definition, with [[Mutual Inductance]]:

Where $N_1, N_2$ represent number of turns in their respective inductors.
and:
$$V_i=N_i\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$
Ideal Transformer Assumptions:
- Self, Mutual Inductance $\to\infty$
- $\kappa=1$ (Perfect Coupling)
- Conservation of Energy, No energy loss through heat, etc.

Conservation of Power, too:
$$V_1i_1=V_2i_2$$
From $Z=\frac{V}{i}$:
$$\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}=(\frac{N_1}{N_2})^2$$
