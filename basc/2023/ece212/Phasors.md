From Sinusoidal Signals:

$$V(t)=V_p\cos(\omega t+\theta)$$
- $\theta\to +$: "Leading" (Earlier time to left)
- $\theta\to -$: "Lagging" (Later Time to right)

From [[Complex Functions]]:
$$V(t)=Re\{V_pe^{j(\omega t+\theta)}\}=Re\{V_pe^{j\theta}e^{j\omega t}\}$$
But for our purposes, we only care about $e^{j\theta}$ where $\vec V$ is to be thought of as a vector in the Complex Plane:
$$\vec V=V_pe^{j\theta}=V_p\angle\theta$$
