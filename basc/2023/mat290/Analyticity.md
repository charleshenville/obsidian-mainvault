## A function, $f(z)$ is said to be analytic at $z_0$ if:
- $f'(z)$ exists in a neighbourhood of $z_0$ ([[Set Definitions for Complex Analysis]])
- Analyticity implies [[Differentiability]] implies [[Continuity]].

To find out if a function is Analytic we should:
1. Check [[Cauchy-Riemann Equations]]
2. Check [[Continuity]] in $u, v, u_x, u_y, v_x, v_y$

If $f(z)$ is Analytic, then
- $u(x,y), v(x,y)$ are Harmonic Functions, and Solutions to [[Laplace's Equations]].

## General Criterion:
Suppose the real-valued functions _u_(_x_, _y_) and _v_(_x_, _y_) are continuous and have continuous first-order partial derivatives in a domain _D_. If _u_ and _v_ satisfy the [[Cauchy-Riemann Equations]] at all points of _D_, then the complex function _f_(_z_) = _u_(_x_, _y_) + _iv_(_x_, _y_) is analytic in _D_.
