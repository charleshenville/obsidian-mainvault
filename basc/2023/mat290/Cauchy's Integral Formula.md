By extension of the "Very important" formula for $z_0$ interior to $C$:
$$\oint_C\frac{1}{(z-z_0)^{n}}dz = 2\pi i, n=1$$
$$\oint_C\frac{1}{(z-z_0)^{n}}dz = 0, n>1,n\in\mathbb{Z}$$
We have the formula, if $f(z)$ displays [[Analyticity]] on and within $C$, with $z_0$ interior to $C$, then:
$$f(z_0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_C\frac{f(z)}{z-z_0}dz$$
or, more usefully:
$$\oint_C\frac{f(z)}{z-z_0}dz={2\pi i}\cdot f(z_0)$$
## And more generally, since $f(z)$ has any amount of derivatives due to displaying [[Analyticity]]:
$$\oint_C\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}}dz=\frac{2\pi i\cdot f^{(n)}(z_0)}{n!}$$
