In MAT290, we deal with **Simple Closed Contours**:
- C breaks the imaginary $\mathbb{R}^2$ into a bounded and unbounded space.

## Theorem: If we have a Simple, closed Contour over $f(z)$ which displays [[Analyticity]] everywhere within that Contour, (a [[Simply Connected Domain]]) then Cauchy-Goursat Theorem applies and:
$$\oint_Cf(z)dz=0$$
And of course this applies to Entire Functions, which display [[Analyticity]] everywhere.
