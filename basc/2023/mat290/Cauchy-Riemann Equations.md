## A requirement for $f(z)$ if we say it displays [[Differentiability]], and [[Analyticity]] by consequence.

## They are as Follows for $f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$:
$$\frac{∂u}{∂x}=\frac{∂v}{∂y}$$
$$\frac{∂v}{∂x}=-\frac{∂u}{∂y}$$
We can use these equations through a convoluted derivation process to find an expression for [[Derivatives of Complex Functions]]:
$$f'(z)=\frac{∂u}{∂x}+i\frac{∂v}{∂x}=u_x+iv_x=v_y-iu_y=u_x-iu_y=v_x+iv_y$$
