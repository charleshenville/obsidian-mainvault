We will likely employ some kind of parametrization to compute these, for this to work we must have satisfaction of the [[Cauchy-Riemann Equations]]:
$$\int_Cf(z)dz=\int_Cf(z(t))\frac{dz}{dt}dt$$
# The Very Important Integral, from [[Cauchy's Integral Formula]]:
$$\oint_C(z-z_0)^ndz$$ where $C\to|z-z_0|=\rho$:

Can parameterize as:
$$z(t)=\rho e^{it}+z_0$$
## We can say that:
$$\oint_C(z-z_0)^ndz = 2\pi i$$ if $n=1$, otherwise it equals zero.
