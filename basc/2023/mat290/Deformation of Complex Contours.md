If we have situations like the following [[Complex Contour Integrals]]:
![[IMG_1251FB440A41-1.jpeg]]
We discover that, via eventual application of [[Cauchy-Goursat Integral Theorem]]:
$$\oint_{C_1}f(z)dz=\oint_{C_2}f(z)dz$$
But note that this is only true if $f(z)$ displays [[Analyticity]] everywhere within $C_1$ and $C_2$.

We can extend this postulate to sum up many domains that are not [[Simply Connected Domain]]s:

$$\oint_Cf(z)dz=\sum_{k=1}^n\oint_{C_k}f(z)dz$$
