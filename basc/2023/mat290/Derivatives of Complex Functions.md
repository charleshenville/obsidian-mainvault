## Defined via [[Limits of Complex Functions]], for [[Complex Functions]]:
$$\Delta z=\Delta x+i\Delta y$$
$$f'(z_0)=\lim\limits_{\Delta z\to0}\frac{f(z_0+\Delta z)-f(z_0)}{\Delta z}$$
And this must exist at all [[Path Function]]s for the function to display [[Differentiability]].

## If u, v and their first partials display [[Continuity]], they merit the assertion of f(z)'s [[Differentiability]].
