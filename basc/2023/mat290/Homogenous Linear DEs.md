The $n_{th}$ order homogeneous linear [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] $L(y) = 0$
always has $n$ linearly independent solutions; if:$$y_1(x), y_2(x), ..., y_n(x)$$ are these particular solutions, then the general solution of $L(Y) = 0$ is
$$y(x) = c_1y_1(x) + c_2y_2(x)+ ... + c_ny_n(x)$$
where $c_1, c_2, ..., c_3$ are arbitrary constants. These form a vector space of dimension $n$.
