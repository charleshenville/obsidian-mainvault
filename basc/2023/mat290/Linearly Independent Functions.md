The $n$ functions $f_1, f_2, ..., f_n$ are said to be linearly dependent on the interval $I$, provided: $$ \exists\space (c_1, c_2,..., c_n) \neq 0\mid c_1f_1(x) + c_2f_2(x) + ... + c_nf_n(x) = 0$$For $x\in I$. 

If the only solution is the trivial one, $c_1 = c_2 = ... c_n = 0$, then the functions are linearly independent. 

$\det(A)\neq0\to \vec a_1,\vec a_2, ...,\vec a_n$ are linearly independent.

If we use the [[Wronskian]] and it is non-zero for all $x\in I$, and its constituents are solutions to the differential equation, then we have a linearly independent set of solutions to the [[Ordinary Differential Equations]].
