## Via a sort of Fundamental Theorem of Complex Integral Calculus:
- We can say that if $f(z)$ displays [[Analyticity]] in a [[Simply Connected Domain]], $D$, that is, $f(z)$ possess an antiderivative that also displays [[Analyticity]] on $D$:
$$F'(z)=f(z)$$
And via a proof involving the [[Cauchy-Goursat Integral Theorem]]:
$$\int_{C\subset D}f(z)dz=F(z_2)-F(z_1)$$
Where $z_1$ and $z_2$ are, respectively, the starting and ending points of $C$. 

## Thus, for any $C\subset D$ with starting and ending points $z_1$ and $z_2$ we have equal [[Complex Contour Integrals]].
