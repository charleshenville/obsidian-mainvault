## Suppose we have a [[Homogenous Linear DEs]] with constant coefficients:
$$a_ny^{(n)}+a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)}+\dots+a_1y'+a_0y=0$$
By using $y=e^{mx}$, as a solution guess, we can obtain the **Characteristic Equation**:
$$a_nm^{n}+a_{n-1}m^{n-1}+\dots+a_1m+a_0=0$$
From which we get n, linearly independent solutions:
$$e^{m_1x},e^{m_2x},\dots e^{m_nx}$$
Where $m_i$ corresponds to roots of our characteristic equation. Where any given $m$ can be:
1. Distinct and $\in\mathbb{R}$
2. Distinct and $\in\mathbb{C}$ ([[Complex Functions]])
3. Repeated real or complex. (Still linearly independent solutions since we can have both $e^{mx}$ and $xe^{mx}$).
