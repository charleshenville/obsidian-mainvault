# If f is continuous and First Order [[Partial Derivative]]s of f are continuous in a [[Neighbourhood]] of $(a,b)$ (Reference):
$$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}(a,b)=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x}(a,b)$$
Subsequently, If f and its First Order [[Partial Derivative]]s are continuous in all of $\mathbb{R}^2$ :
$$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}(x,y)=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x}(x,y)$$
