A oriented embedding of $\mathbb{R}$ into a $\geq$ dimension:

- These become problematic when there is self-intersection.
- Usually 2 available directions or orientations.

We can represent these objects mathematically in the following ways:
1. Parametrically:$$\vec r(t)=<x(t), y(t), z(t)>$$ with orientation specified in the direction of increasing t.
2. As a level curve:$$\{f(x,y)=C\}$$Applicable to only curves in 2D. Orientation must be explicitly defined.
