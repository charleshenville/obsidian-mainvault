# $f$ is Differentiable at $(a,b)$ if, "zoomed in":
$$f(x,y)\approx L_{(a,b)}(x,y)$$
$$\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (a,b)}\frac{f(x,y)-L_{(a,b)}(x,y)}{\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}}=0$$
Where $L_{(a,b)}(x,y)$ is the [[Tangent Plane]] of $f(x,y)|_{(a,b)}$

If $f$ is Differentiable at $(a,b)$, then it displays [[Continuity]] there.
Note that every [[Partial Derivative]] must also exist at $(a,b)$.

Additionally, if $f(a,b)$, and its partials are continuous and defined on the [[Neighbourhood]] of $(a,b)$, It is Differentiable there.
