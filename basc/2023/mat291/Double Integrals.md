## For $f(x,y)=z$ $$\iint f(x,y)dA$$represents the signed volume under the surface:

# Domain of Integration
- Any set in the Domain of $f$, typically $[a,b]$ in MAT291.
- if $f(x,y)=1$:
$$\iint_SdA=vol(S)$$

## Note that if we have an Odd Function:

$$f(-x,-y)=-f(x,y)$$
For the [[Double Rectangular Domains of Integration]], $R$ (encapsulating blue) as follows:

We have the identity:
$$\iint_Rf(x,y)dA=0$$
Since red is negative yellow and green is negative purple.
