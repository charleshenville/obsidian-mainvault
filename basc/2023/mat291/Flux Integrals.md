The flux of $\vec F$ through $C$ is defined as:
$$\int_C\vec F\cdot\hat nds$$
Orientation (inwards or outwards) matters as it affects our choice for the [[Unit Normal]], $\hat n$.

Note the Flux of the left diagram is nonzero, whereas it is zero for the right.

It is a measure of how much (in/out) the Force Field passes through $C$.
