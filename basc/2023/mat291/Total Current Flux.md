### Find the Total current flux through the region $S: \{(x,y,z): x=0, y\in [-1,2], z\in [-1,1]\}$ in which we have: 
- An infinite cylindrical shell with radius $R\leq 1$ and current flux density $\vec J_1$ in the $+\hat y$ direction that is aligned with and centred around the y-axis. 
- An infinitely thin wire parallel to the z-axis passing through the point (0, 1, 0) with current flux density $\vec J_2$ upwards. 
- An infinite, thick plane with height 2 parallel to the x-y plane centred around z=1 and uniform current flux density $\vec J_3$ in the $+\hat x$ direction.
#### Answer: $3J_3$
