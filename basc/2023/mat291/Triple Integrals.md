## We have the general Definition:

$$\iiint_S f(x,y,z)dV$$
Which represents:
- The signed 4-D Hyper-volume "under" the graph of $f(x,y,z)$ "over" the region $S$.
- More usefully, sum of infinitely small 4-D partitions.

## Over Rectangular Regions:
- Similar to that of [[Double Integrals]] and [[Double Rectangular Domains of Integration]]. We can employ Fubini's Theorem.
- We are now dealing with Rectangular prism domains of integration.

$$R=[a,b]\times[c,d]\times[e,g]$$
$$\iiint_Rf(x,y,z)dV=\int_a^b\int_c^d\int_e^gf(x,y,z)dzdydx$$
### Note that we have $3!=6$ possibilities for the order of taking the individual integrals.
