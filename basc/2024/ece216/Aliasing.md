## Family of Distinct DT [[Complex Exponential Signals]] 
i. $e^{jωn}$ is periodic in n with period $N$ iff $ω=\frac{2\pi}{N}k$ for some $k∈\mathbb{Z}$
ii. $e^{jωn}$ is always periodic in $ω$ with period $2π$

### Let $N_0 ∈ Z≥1$ be a desired period. Then there are exactly $N_0$ distinct DT complex exponential signals of period $N_0$, given by
$$φ_k[n]=e^{jkω_0n}, k∈\{0,1,...,N_0 −1\} \text{ where } ω_0 = \frac{2\pi}{N_0}$$
