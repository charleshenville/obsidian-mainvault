# We propose that for [[Linear Time-Invariant Systems]], they are Causal iff:$$\forall t_0\in\mathbb{R}, x(t):x(t)=0\space\forall\space t\leq t_0$$$$y(t)=T\{x\}\text{ satisfies }y(t)=0\space\forall\space t\leq t_0$$
# It is apparent how this would apply then to right-sided Causal systems and their corresponding right-sided inputs.
