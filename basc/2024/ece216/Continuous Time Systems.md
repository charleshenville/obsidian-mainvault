Where $y(t)=T\{x\}(t)$ represents the output signal at a time $t\in\mathbb{R}$:
-  Defined point wise in terms of explicit transformations or formulas that map [[Continuous Time Signals]] to [[Continuous Time Signals]].
- eg $y(t)=(x(t))^2$.

# More System Examples
## Average over $[t-a,t+a]$:$$T_{\text{avg}}(t)=\frac{1}{2a}\int_{t-a}^{t+a}x(\tau)d\tau$$
