Yes to both. For approximating the square wave itself, we can see that we get more extreme slopes that more closely resemble those of the square wave, and tighter oscillations around where the square wave is meant to be at a constant value. For output response, with increasing amount of terms in the [[Continuous Time Fourier Series]], we can see the maximum value of the transient response approach that of the square wave (0.76V, from values less than it)
