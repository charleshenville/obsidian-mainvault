## Repetition of the same experiment

Reduces to **Bernoulli Trials**:
- Success (1), prob $p$ or Fail (0), prob $1-p$$$S=\{0,1\}$$
- $$P[k\text{ Successes in }n\text{ trials}]=\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^k$$
- This is known as the Binomial Probability Law

# Sequential Dependent Trials
- Markov Chain: Where you transition from some state to some state and your **only dependence is on the previous state**. See this example below:
- We can then leverage properties of non-[[Independence]]
