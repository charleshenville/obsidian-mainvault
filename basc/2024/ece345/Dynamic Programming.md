# Dividing and Conquering
- Large problem to smaller problem
- Characteristics include
	- Optimal Substructure
		- based on optimal solutions to sub-problems
		- applies to Greedy*?
	- Overlapping subproblems
		- Unique to DP
		- Reuse subproblem solutions
		- Memorization - memorizing solutions from subproblems to reuse them in future subproblem
