### See [[Random Experiments]] for rule of Products/Sums 

# Permutation
- Number of ways to arrange $r$ objects from $n$ different objects. Order matters, see [[Sampling Methods]]:
$$P(n,r)=nPr=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
### If we have Sample Spaces with duplicate items, where $q_i$ represents amount of objects in a uniform group, we have this as the number of ways:
$$\frac{n!}{q_1!q_2!\dots q_t!}$$
# Combination
- Same as permutation but order doesn't matter
$$C(n,r)=nCr=\frac{n!}{(n-r!)r!}$$
