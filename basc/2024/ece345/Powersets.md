# Powerset of $S$: 
- All Combinations of S plus null set $âˆ…$

# Example with [[Proofs By Induction]]
- Proving $2^S$ has cardinality $2^{|S|}$
## Basis: $n=1$, $2^S$ has 2 elements = $2^1$
## Hypothesis: Assuming true for $|S|=n$, $|2^{S}|=2^{|S|}$
## Inductive Step: Showing for $|S|=n+1$
- Show for S and add an element to S to see how it changes in size (it doubles!)
