# Showing $\sqrt 2$ is irrational
- Prove the opposite to have a contradiction; is a counterexample
	- Atac: $\sqrt 2=\frac{a}{b},a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$, and a and b do not have common factors
	- Square both sides: $2=\frac{a^2}{b^2}$
		- $2b^2=a^2$, thus $a^2$ is even and then $a$ is even since it can't be odd.
			- Means $a=2k$
$$(2k)^2=2b^2$$
$$4k^2=2b^2$$
$$2k^2=b^2$$
- Thus $b$ must also be even.
- This is a contradiction since if both $a,b$ are even they have a common factor, and they can't as per our original definition.
