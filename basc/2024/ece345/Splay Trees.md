### 1) Zig Rotation:

The Zig Rotation in splay trees operates in a manner similar to the single right rotation in AVL Tree rotations. This rotation results in nodes moving one position to the right from their current location. For example, consider the following scenario:

Zig Rotation (Single Rotation)

### 2) Zag Rotation:

The Zag Rotation in splay trees operates in a similar fashion to the single left rotation in AVL Tree rotations. During this rotation, nodes shift one position to the left from their current location. For instance, consider the following illustration:

Zag Rotation (Single left Rotation)

###  3) Zig-Zig Rotation:

The Zig-Zig Rotation in splay trees is a double zig rotation. This rotation results in nodes shifting two positions to the right from their current location. Take a look at the following example for a better understanding:

Zig-Zig Rotation (Double Right Rotation)

### 4) Zag-Zag Rotation:

In splay trees, the Zag-Zag Rotation is a double zag rotation. This rotation causes nodes to move two positions to the left from their present position. For example:

Zag-Zag Rotation (Double left rotation)

### 5) Zig-Zag Rotation:

The Zig-Zag Rotation in splay trees is a combination of a zig rotation followed by a zag rotation. As a result of this rotation, nodes shift one position to the right and then one position to the left from their current location. The following illustration provides a visual representation of this concept:

Zig- Zag rotation

### 6) Zag-Zig Rotation:

The Zag-Zig Rotation in splay trees is a series of zag rotations followed by a zig rotation. This results in nodes moving one position to the left, followed by a shift one position to the right from their current location. The following illustration offers a visual representation of this concept:
