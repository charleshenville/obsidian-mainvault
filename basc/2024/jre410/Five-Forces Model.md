# Suppliers -> Rivals (This is where we fit) -> Buyers
## When the 5 forces are low ...  
- then industry average profits will be high and it’s an “attractive” industry 
## When the 5 forces are high...  
- then industry average profits will be low and it’s not an  “attractive” industry  
## And not all the 5 forces have to be high for an industry to be unattractive...  
- Blockbuster killed by Netflix, other online competitors  (new entrants and low barriers to switching)

When analyzing these problems we must define industries and key players to make a good assessment of whether forces are high/low. Remember high force is worse.
