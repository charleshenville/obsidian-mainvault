### Summary:

The McDonald's case study discusses the leadership transition and strategic initiatives undertaken by Chris Kempczinski, who became CEO after Steve Easterbrook's dismissal in 2019. It delves into the company's history, from its founding in 1940 to modern challenges such as competition, menu complexities, health trends, and operational inefficiencies. Under Easterbrook’s tenure, McDonald's focused on improving customer experience through technological upgrades, digital innovation, refranchising, and healthier menu items. Despite these efforts, the company continues to struggle with stagnating U.S. restaurant traffic, labor challenges, and competition from other quick-service and fast-casual restaurants.

    - **Dynamic Yield Acquisition**: A $300M investment to enhance machine-learning algorithms for personalized menu suggestions based on customer preferences.

- **Franchising Model**:
    - McDonald’s uses various franchise structures, with a focus on refranchising. Approximately 85% of its restaurants are franchised, and the goal is to increase this to 95%. The company offers financial incentives to franchisees to adopt new technologies and initiatives.

    - **Healthier Offerings**: In response to rising health consciousness, McDonald's has introduced changes such as antibiotic-free chicken, cage-free eggs, and fresh beef for Quarter Pounders.

- **International Growth**:
    - Growth is heavily reliant on international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and Russia, where McDonald’s is expanding aggressively through partnerships.

### Strategic Recommendations:

# Analytics ([[Five-Forces Model]]) on This
- Food Providers (Farmers) -> MacDonalds -> Customer (Average American Consumer)

# Low power of Supplier 
- McDonals is bigger and more globalized than any individual supplier
- McDonalds has lots of options for suppliers for varying ingredients and can switch between them with relative ease
- If regulatory conditions exist for suppliers, they will likely exist for all of them and so makes it easy for McDs to switch.
- Suppliers may be able to supply to a direct competitor of McDonalds - but this may be of relatively low impact
- Suppliers may be able to sell to an alternative like grocery stores or open up their own store to sell to consumers more directly, but they heavily rely on McD and the Fast food industry to increase profits.
- The farmers can't price-fix, the industry is far too large and they will be beat by their many direct competitors.
