### eHarmony Case Study Summary

eHarmony, founded in 2000 by Dr. Neil Clark Warren, became a leading online matchmaking service by focusing on **compatibility-based long-term relationships**. The company differentiated itself through a comprehensive relationship questionnaire and matching algorithm that considered personal traits, values, and interests to foster more meaningful connections. While it successfully attracted marriage-minded individuals, its competitors, such as Match.com and free sites like Plenty of Fish, started challenging its position by offering lower prices or **casual dating alternatives**. eHarmony also faced competition from niche sites and emerging social networks like Facebook.

By 2007, eHarmony experienced significant growth but faced a decision on how to continue expanding amid increasing competitive pressures. The company considered four strategic options: increasing its membership base, broadening its service to cater to casual daters, leveraging research on life stage transitions for new services, or pursuing international expansion.

### Key Insights for Group Discussion

**1. Competitive Strategies**

- **Differentiation Strategy**: eHarmony's unique selling proposition (USP) lies in its **compatibility-focused algorithm**, a clear example of a _broad differentiation strategy_. This allowed eHarmony to command premium pricing in a crowded market while targeting long-term relationships rather than casual dating, which appealed to a niche demographic.
- **Market Segmentation**: eHarmony targeted a niche (serious, marriage-focused individuals) within the broader online dating industry. This is in line with the idea of _focused differentiation_, one of Porter’s five generic competitive strategies covered.

**2. Innovation & Barriers to Entry**

- eHarmony's patent on its matching algorithm demonstrates its investment in _innovation_, a key to maintaining its competitive edge. As discussed in Lecture 4, innovation is essential for differentiation but also costly to maintain​.
- Competitors like Chemistry.com and free sites such as Plenty of Fish started imitating eHarmony’s features, highlighting the challenge of sustaining differentiation over time (Lecture 4 discusses the difficulty of maintaining differentiation when rivals can easily imitate)​.

**3. Competitive Threats & Strategic Decisions**

- As Lecture 4 emphasizes, strategic analysis requires assessing both external threats and internal strengths. eHarmony’s competitors, such as Match.com, increased their marketing efforts and launched Chemistry.com, offering lower-cost alternatives that threatened eHarmony's market share.
- eHarmony’s decision to either continue focusing on long-term relationships or expand to more casual daters reflects the tension between staying true to a niche or broadening to a larger audience, akin to shifting from a _focused differentiation_ to a broader strategy.

**4. Marketing & Customer Acquisition**

- eHarmony’s high customer acquisition costs, particularly its substantial investments in TV and radio advertising, align with strategies aimed at achieving superior long-term profitability, as highlighted in the lecture. It invested heavily in creating a brand associated with serious relationships, leveraging testimonials to enhance trust​.

These insights connect the case study to the broader concepts of competitive strategy, differentiation, and innovation discussed in the lecture.
