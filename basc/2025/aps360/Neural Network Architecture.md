# We need Hidden Layers
- Use Backpropagation, a method that describes how to distribute errors to neurons not adjacent to the output layer

- IE we have to be able to map our data to some space that we know is linearly separable so that we can solve it with trivial [[Artificial Neural Networks]]

## Feed-Forward Network
Information only flows forward from one layer to a later layer, from the input to the output.
## Fully-Connected Network
Neurons between adjacent layers are fully connected.
## Number of Layers
Number of hidden layers + output layer
