- Moniker **KR&R**
# Representation
- **Symbolic** encodings believed/ stored by an agent (**explicit**)
# Reasoning
- Manipulation of Symbolic Representation to get new **implicit** representations 
- "John is Mary's father" $\to$ "John is an adult male"
- allows for KR compression

This strategy can be better than [[Neural Network Architecture]]s since we may have a complex systems whose fundamentals may need to be explicitly laid out. We also may not have sufficient data.
