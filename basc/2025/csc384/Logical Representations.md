## Knowledge-Based Systems
This is an attempt to represent knowledge **(KB)** and has a reasoning system **(Inference Engine)**. Infers new knowledge within the domain given KB.
### Logical Entitlement
Sentences $P_1,\dots, P_n$ entail $P\iff$ $P$'s truth is implicit in the truth of sequences ($P_1,\dots, P_n\to P$).
### Logic & Logical Inference
Study of entailment relations/ truth conditions, rules of inference. Inference is just Calculating Entailments.

This leads us to [[First-Order Logic]] (FOL).
