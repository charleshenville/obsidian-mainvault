Used In Generic Approaches
# [[State-Space Model]]
- In this context is a representation of a problem and the space would be the set of all possible configurations, see [[Powersets]]
### Restrictions
- Dedicated **Actions/Successor Functions**
- **Costs**
- **Heuristic** Functions
- Goal States

# Search [[Trees]]
- nodes include path (or alternatively parental pointers), state and cost data

# State [[Graphs]]
- vertices are states and edges represent possible successor functions
