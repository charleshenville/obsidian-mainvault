# Mutual Coherence is true for two waves where 
$$\frac{d}{dt}(\phi_1-\phi_2)=0$$
- This is also a necessary, but insufficient condition for [[Interference]].

We can define the length of a train as the temporal coherence, $\tau_c$:$$\tau_c=\frac{2\pi}{\Delta\omega}$$
And a physical coherence length, $l_c$:$$l_c=c\tau_c$$
