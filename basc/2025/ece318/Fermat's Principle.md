### Light, in going from point A to point B, traverses the route that has the shortest optical path length (OPL from [[Geometric Optics]]).
- This implies Reversibility

# Graded-Index Materials (GRIN)
- Changing Refractive Index, $n(y)$, with respect to some change in distance\

- Via Snell's Law we can get the **Paraxial Ray Equation** for the ray $y(z)$: $$\frac{d^2y}{dz^2}=\frac{1}{n(y)}\frac{dn}{dy}$$
