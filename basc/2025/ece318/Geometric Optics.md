# Index of Refraction $(n)$
- Macroscopic optical property of the medium
- In the context of Geometric Optics, refractive index of a medium quantifies the **bending** of an oblique light ray when **entering the medium from vacuum**

# Optical Path Length (OPL)
-Physical path length of the ray weighted by the refractive index of the medium. [[Line Integrals]] applicable here.
$$\text{OPL}=\int_A^Bn(s)ds$$
