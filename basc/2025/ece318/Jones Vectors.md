# With [[Polarization State of Light]]$${\bf J}=\begin{bmatrix} E_{xo}e^{i\phi_x}\\E_{yo}e^{i\phi_y}\end{bmatrix}$$
- We record the polarization state as a vector, we can look at this and have a complete picture of the polarization state.
- These are non-unique as we can multiply by any scalar and have the same polarization state representation.
- Usually represented as unity magnitude
- Can be used as an expansion basis: $\textbf{J}=\alpha\textbf{J}_1+\beta\textbf{J}_2$
