Leveraging Laws of [[Geometric Optics]]
![[Pasted image 20250117234435.png]]
- **Object**: Light Rays Entering the Imaging System
	- Real if divergence upon entering
	- Virtual if convergence upon entering
- **Image**: Light Rays Exiting the Imaging System
	- Real if convergence upon entering
	- Virtual if divergence upon entering

# Reversibility
- Most of these systems we study will be reversible, meaning that you can "reproduce" the object at O by emitting from I instead.

# Aperture Stop
- Limits light reaching image
# Field Stop
- Limits size/$\alpha$r breadth of object (setting FOV)
