## Isotropic
- Independent of direction of $\bf E$ 
- $\epsilon_r$ is a scalar
- Polarization Induced is the same direction as $\bf E$
- Usually Amorphous like glass
## Anisotropic
- Optical Properties of medium depend on on direction of $\bf E$
- $\epsilon_r$ is a tensor
- Polarization induced does not align with $\bf E$
- Calcite is a good example

# Dichroism
- Used to make polarizers as they essentially choose just one component from an incident beam.
