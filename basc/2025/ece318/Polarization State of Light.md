# Elliptical Polarization
- Just means x and y components are out of phase
## Circular

## Transforming from Circular To Linear Through Elliptical
- $\frac{\pi}{2}$ phase shift is the worst but we can move towards 0 diff to get linear, but we have to go through an elliptical stage to do this. if $\phi_y-\phi_x=m\pi$ then we have linear.
