- For [[Polarization State of Light]], using [[Boundary Conditions]]
# TE & TM Polarizations

- All waves must have the same frequency to satisfy [[Boundary Conditions]]
- The phase angle should also match
- wavefronts in [[Plane Waves]] must "line up"

### If we say that the y axis is normal to the boundary:
- For the TE case, $E_z, H_x$ display [[Continuity]]
- For the TM case, $E_x, H_z$ display [[Continuity]]
