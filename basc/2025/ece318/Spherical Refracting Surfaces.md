If light rays travel from left to right, then **(Real is Positive)**
- $s_o$ is positive when *O* is to the left of *V* (i.e., _real object_)
- $s_i$ is positive when *I* is to the right of *V* (i.e., _real image_)
- $R$ is positive when *C* is to the right of *V*

Applying Law Of Sines to the Two Triangles Depicted and Laws of [[Geometric Optics]]: $$\frac{l_0}{n_i(s_0+R)}=\frac{l_i}{n_t(s_i-R)}$$
Also, If $\phi >> 0$, we can use the FO Small angle [[Taylor Series]] approximation and get the following **Gaussian Formula** for **Paraxial Approximation**:$$\frac{n_i}{s_o}+\frac{n_t}{s_i}=\frac{n_t-n_i}{R}$$
- Significant since it provides relationship between object and image distance.

## Transverse Magnification Formula $$M_T\equiv\frac{y_i}{y_o}=-\frac{s_i-R}{s_o+R}=-\frac{n_is_i}{n_ts_o}$$
- Derived using similar triangles

## Longitudinal Magnification Formula$$M_L\equiv\frac{ds_i}{ds_o}=-\frac{n_is_i^2}{n_ts_o^2}$$
- Derived from derivative of the Gaussian Formula Above

### When $M_L\neq M_T$ 
- the image distorts
### Equivalence of Optical Path Length 
- All rays emitted by O and reaching I have identical OPL due to the refractive indices and how OPL is defined.

See [[Focal Length]].

#### Note: We can model a flat refractive surface as a. spherical one where the Radius is infinite.
