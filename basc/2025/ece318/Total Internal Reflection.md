## Two Primary Conditions we have to satisfy
- $n_i > n_t$, ie the incident wave traverses through the denser of the two mediums
- $\theta_i>\theta_c$, ie the incident angle is past the critical angle.

In relation to [[Fresnel Coefficients]]:

## The Critical Angle
- An incident angle such that when it is refracted has an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ relative to the interface.

## Transmitted Wave Properties
- Evanescent/Complex
- Non-Transverse
