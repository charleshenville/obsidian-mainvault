# Week 7 (Groups and Teams)
### Groups
- **Definition**: A group consists of two or more people interacting interdependently to achieve a common goal
- **Key elements**: Interaction, interdependence, common goal
- **Formal groups**: Established by organizations to facilitate achievement of organizational goals
- **Informal groups**: Emerge naturally in response to common interests of organizational members
### Group Development Stages
- **Forming**: Initial orientation, getting acquainted ->
- **Storming**: Conflict stage, clarification of roles and expectations ->
- **Norming**: Development of cohesion, establishment of rules and standards ->
- **Performing**: Goal accomplishment, high productivity ->
- **Adjourning**: Completion, disbanding of the group (same level as Forming in stage of development)
- Most groups move through these stages, though not always linearly. These stages are often evident in project teams, though the storming phase may be subtle in professional contexts where conflict is managed. Some groups may cycle between stages, especially when facing new challenges or when membership changes.
### Group Structure Elements
1. **Size**:
    - Larger groups experience less satisfaction, more conflict, less participation
    - Size affects performance differently based on task type
2. **Diversity**:
    - Initially may cause communication challenges
    - Can eventually lead to better outcomes for creative tasks
    - Surface diversity effects (age, gender, race) tend to wear off over time
3. **Norms**:
    - Collective expectations about behavior
    - Guide appropriate conduct
    - Types: dress norms, performance norms, reward allocation norms
    - Most normative influence is unconscious
4. **Roles**:
    - Positions with expected behaviors attached
    - Assigned roles: Formally prescribed
    - Emergent roles: Develop naturally
    - Role types: Task roles, maintenance roles, hindering roles
	- ![[Pasted image 20250407170630.png]]
	- Role problems: Ambiguity (unclear goals/methods), conflict (incompatible expectations)
5. **Status (Who's the GL?)**:
    - Rank or social position accorded to members
    - Formal vs. informal status systems
    - Higher-status members do more talking and have more influence
    - Large status differences can inhibit upward communication
6. **Cohesiveness**:
	- **Definition**: Degree to which a group is attractive to its members.
	- **Factors affecting cohesiveness**:
	    - Threat and competition
	    - Success
	    - Member diversity
	    - Group size (smaller = more cohesive!)
	    - Toughness of initiation
	- **Consequences**:
	    - More participation in group activities
	    - More conformity to group norms
	    - More success in goal achievement
	    - Lower turnover and absenteeism
	    - Less variation in productivity among members
### Task Types and Group Size
- **Additive tasks**: Performance depends on sum of individual efforts (larger groups = better)
- **Disjunctive tasks**: Performance depends on best member (larger groups = better)
- **Conjunctive tasks**: Performance limited by poorest performer (smaller groups = better)
### Social Loafing
- **Definition**: The tendency to withhold effort when performing group tasks
- **Types**:
    - Free rider effect: Lowering effort to get benefits at others' expense
    - Sucker effect (equity): Lowering effort because others are perceived as free-riding
- **Prevention strategies**:
    - Make individual performance visible
    - Keep group size small
    - Make work interesting
    - Increase feelings of indispensability
    - Increase performance feedback
    - Reward group performance
### Teams vs. Groups
- Teams are *work-focused* groups in organizational settings
- **Cross-functional teams**: Bring people with different specialties together.
    - Goals: Innovation, speed, quality through early coordination
    - Requirements for effectiveness:
        - Composition (all relevant specialties)
        - Superordinate goals
        - Autonomy
        - Rules and procedures
        - Strong leadership
### High-Performing Team Characteristics
1. Share common purpose
2. Effectively use individual talents (X-f(x))
3. Balance roles and share tasks
4. Focus energy on problem-solving
5. Accept differences of opinion
6. Encourage risk-taking and creativity
7. Set high personal performance standards
8. Identify sources of professional and personal growth
## Factors Influencing Work Group Effectiveness
- **Task**: Challenge, complexity, interdependence
- **Group composition**: Stability, size, expertise, diversity
- **Managerial support**: Training, rewards, encouragement of independence
- **Group processes**: Effort, knowledge application, performance strategies
# Week 8 (Decision Making)

**Decision Making**: The process of *developing a commitment* to some course of action to solve a problem (a gap between existing and desired states). Involves making choices, following a process, and committing resources.
**Bikeshedding (Parkinson's Law of Triviality)**: Tendency to spend disproportionate time on trivial matters and less time on important issues.
**Justification**: People often devote energy to justifying faulty decisions rather than evaluating them objectively.

| **Well**-Structured Problems                                                                                                                                                            | **Ill**-Structured Problems                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Existing and desired states are clear<br>- Path between states is fairly obvious<br>- Repetitive and familiar<br>- Can be solved using rules, routines, standard operating procedures | - Existing and desired states are unclear<br>- Path to solution is unknown<br>- Unique, unusual, not previously encountered<br>- Complex with high uncertainty<br>- Often arouse controversy and conflict |
## Rational Decision-Making Process
1. Identify Problem
2. Search for Relevant Information
3. Develop Alternative Solutions
4. Evaluate Alternative Solutions
5. Choose Best Solution
6. Implement Chosen Solution
7. Monitor and Evaluate Results

## Decision-Making Models

**Perfect Rationality**:
- Decision strategy that is completely informed, perfectly logical, oriented toward economic gain
- Represented by the "Economic Person" who:
    - Can gather information without cost
    - Is perfectly logical
    - Has only one criterion: economic gain and value

**Bounded Rationality**:
- Decision strategy based on limited information, time constraints, political considerations
- Leads to **satisficing** (accepting "good enough" solutions) rather than **maximizing**
- Affected by framing, cognitive biases, emotions and mood
## Comparing Perfect vs. Bounded Rationality

| **Stage**                | **Perfect** Rationality         | **Bounded** Rationality                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Problem Identification* | Easy, accurate perception       | Perceptual defense, attention to symptoms               |
| *Information Search*     | Free, fast, right amount        | Slow, costly, too little/much info                      |
| *Alternative Solutions*  | Can conceive of all             | Not all known                                           |
| *Evaluation*             | Ultimate value known, objective | Potential miscalculation, political factors             |
| *Solution Choice*        | Maximizes                       | Satisfices                                              |
| *Implementation*         | Considered in evaluation        | May be difficult due to reliance on others              |
| *Evaluation*             | Objective                       | May involve justification, escalation, faulty hindsight |
## Cognitive Biases and Framing

**Framing**: How problems and decision alternatives are presented, significantly impacts decisions.
**Cognitive Biases**: Tendencies to process information in error-prone ways, affecting all people regardless of intelligence:
- Overconfidence
- Confirmation bias (seeking info that confirms existing beliefs)
- Recency effect (overweighting recent information)
- Law of small numbers (generalizing from too few examples)
- Anchoring effect (relying too heavily on initial information)
- Hindsight bias (believing we "knew it all along" after outcomes are known)
## Escalation of Commitment
**Escalation of Commitment**: Tendency to invest additional resources in a failing course of action.
- Driven by dissonance reduction, social pressure for consistency
- Related to sunk cost fallacy
- Social norms favor consistent behavior, especially from leaders
- Decision makers don't want to appear wasteful
- The problem is framed around recovering sunk costs rather than future prospects
- Personality traits, moods, and emotions can affect willingness to persist

**Sunk Costs**: Resources already spent that cannot be recovered; should be irrelevant to future decisions.

**Preventing Escalation (Commitment Bias)**:
- Reframe problems (focus on saving rather than spending)
- Set specific goals
- Evaluate decision process rather than outcomes
- Separate initial and subsequent decision making
## Emotions and Mood in Decision Making
- Strong emotions can help or hinder decisions
- Mood affects what and how people think when deciding
- People in positive moods remember positive information and evaluate more positively
- Greatest impact on uncertain, ambiguous decisions
## Group Decision Making
**Advantages**:
- Decision quality (more vigilant, more ideas, better evaluation)
- Decision acceptance and commitment
- Diffusion of responsibility

**When Groups Perform Better**:
- Members differ in relevant skills (without excessive conflict)
- Division of labor is possible
- Memory for facts is important
- Individual judgments can be weighted by expertise

**Disadvantages**:
- Time (inefficiency)
- Conflict (personal agendas)
- Domination by individuals
- Groupthink

**Groupthink**: Group pressure that damages mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment.
**Symptoms of Groupthink**:
- Mindguards (protecting group from contrary information)
- Illusion of invulnerability
- Belief in group's superior morality
- Pressure to conform
- Illusion of unanimity
- Self-censorship
- Stereotyping opponents
- Rationalization

**Preventing Groupthink**:
- Leaders avoid pressuring for specific outcomes
- Establish norms encouraging dissent
- Bring in outside experts
- Create psychological safety
## Improving Organizational Decision Making
- Training discussion leaders
- Stimulating and managing controversy
- Brainstorming (traditional and electronic)
- Nominal group technique
- Delphi technique
# Week 9 (Organizational Change and Negotiation)
## Organizational Change
- Organizations in dynamic environments must show *more change* to be effective than those in stable environments
- Orgs *can change*: Structure, Technology, People, Processes, Goals and strategies, Culture, Branding, Job design, etc.
**Organizational change**: Alternation of structure, technology, processes, or people within an organization; can be planned or unplanned transformation
**External forces**: Changes in the surrounding environment that organizations must adapt to (market, tech, disruptions)
**Internal forces**: Changes provoked by factors within the organization (management, culture, etc.)
## Lewin's 3-Step Model For Change
![[Pasted image 20250408181320.png]]
**Unfreezing** >:
    - Recognizing need for change
    - Generating dissatisfaction with status quo
    - Rewarding change
    - Crises especially likely to stimulate unfreezing
**Changing** >:
    - Implementing planned change
    - Establishing goals
**Refreezing**:
    - Stabilizing change
    - Accepting newly changed state
    - Examining effectiveness
    - Succeeding, rewarding, institutionalizing, evaluating
**Diagnosis**: Systematic collection of information relevant to impending organizational change
**Resistance to change**: People may resist both unfreezing and change
**Evaluation and institutionalization**: Examining effectiveness and making changes permanent
## Resistance and Reactions to Change
**Individual barriers**:
- Politics and self-interest
- Low individual tolerance for change
- Different assessments of the situation
- Strong emotions / fear of unknown
- Habit
**Organizational barriers**:
- Structural/ Work Group inertia
- Threats to existing balance of power
- Previously unsuccessful change efforts
- Resistant organizational culture
**Acceptance**: Cooperative, enthusiasm
**Indifference**: Apathetic, passive resignation
**Passive resistance**: Not learning, slowing down, protesting
**Active resistance**: Making intentional mistakes, taking time off, deliberate sabotage
==**Overcoming Resistance**==: Gain leadership support, neutralize change resisters, Educate workforce, "Sell" need for change, Involve employees in change effort, create learning orgs.
## Kotter's 8-Step Model for Leading Change
1. Establishing a sense of urgency
2. Forming a powerful guiding coalition
3. Creating a vision
4. Communicating the vision
5. Empowering others to act on the vision
6. Planning for and creating short-term wins
7. Consolidating improvements and producing still more change
8. Institutionalizing new approaches
## Organizational Learning (OL)
Process through which an organization acquires, develops, and transfers knowledge throughout the organization. Methods are **Knowledge Acquisition** and **Knowledge Development**. Learning orgs characterized by:
1. Vision/support
2. Culture
3. Learning systems/dynamics
4. Knowledge management/infrastructure
## Organizational Development (OD)
Designed to plan and implement change in work settings to enhance personal development of individuals and improve organizational effectiveness. Practitioners come from outside org usually. Intervention types include
1. **Team Building**: Efforts to increase work team effectiveness by improving interpersonal processes, goal clarification, and role clarification.
2. **Survey Feedback**: Identify target audience / subject and data to collect, Summarize results and share with stakeholders, then action the feedback and tie back to the survey.
3. **Total Quality Management (TQM)**: Systematic attempt to achieve improvement in quality -> Uses specialized training in tools to empower employees; involves feedback from all stakeholders. Tools include flowcharts, Pareto analysis, statistical process control, fishbone diagrams
4. **Reengineering**: Radical redesign of organizational processes to achieve major improvements, Focuses on activities that create value for internal or external customers
## Negotiation
Involves 2+ parties; Desire for a better deal; Parties expect a "give and take" process
### Negotiation Process
1. **Prepare**: Research industry, organization, job, Avoid naming your price first
2. **Acknowledge**: Convey gratitude and interest, Buy time to review offer, DO NOT immediately negotiate
3. **Plan**: Identify **ZOPA** (Zone of Possible Agreement), Expand the pie (consider all negotiable elements), Know your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement), Develop strategies
4. **Negotiate**: Consider positions, Use integrative approach, Work toward success
### Negotiation Concepts
- **ZOPA** (Zone of Potential Agreement): Space between parties' reservation points
- **Target/Aspiration point**: Your goal (be optimistic but realistic)
- **Resistance point**: A price or outcome below which you will not go
- **BATNA/WATNA**: Best/Worst Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (power to walk away)
	1. Informational sources of power
	2. Position-based power (Legitimate)
	3. Relationship-based sources of power
	4. Contextual (situation or environment) sources of power
	5. Five types: Coercive, Legitimate, Reward, Referent, Expert
### Negotiation Approaches
- **Distributive**: Zero-sum (Win/Lose)
- **Integrative**: Non-zero-sum (Win/Win); Creates free flow of information, Gets to real needs and objectives, Emphasizes common ground, Searches for common solutions
- Lowball/Highball, Bogey (playing up a minor issue), The Nibble (small concessions), Intimidation/Aggressive Behavior, Snow Job (overwhelm with information), Ignore, Discuss, Respond in kind, Befriend

# Week 10 (Conflict and Stress)
## Conflict
Conflict occurs when one person, group, or organizational subunit frustrates the goal attainment of another. Can involve antagonistic attitudes and behaviors, but can also be respectful and collegial.
### Organizational Conflict Causes
1. **Group Identification and Intergroup Bias**: People develop more positive views of their own "in-group", Self-esteem is a critical factor
2. **Interdependence**: When individuals/subunits are mutually dependent on each other; Necessitates interaction; implies each party has power over the other; Doesn't always lead to conflict
3. **Ambiguity**: Ambiguous goals, jurisdictions, or performance criteria
4. **Differences in Power, Status, and Culture**: *Power*: If dependence is one-way rather than mutual, *Status*: Less conflict when lower-status people depend on higher-status, *Culture*: Clash in beliefs and values can cause overt conflict
5. **Scarce Resources**: Conflict during power jockeying (competing for power), Limited budget, support, or space
### Types of Conflict
1. **Relationship conflict**: Interpersonal tensions, personality clashes
2. **Task Conflict**: About the nature of work, differences of opinion about goals or technical matters.
3. **Process Conflict**: Disagreements about work organization, disagreements about responsibility, authority, resource
4. **Ethical Conflicts**: Disagreements over what is morally or philosophically correct
5. **Institutional Conflicts**: Differences over what is legal or consistent with public policy
### Consequences of Conflict in Teams
- Detrimental to member satisfaction and team performance
- *Prevents development of cohesiveness*
- Some task conflict can be beneficial for performance, not all conflict is detrimental.
### Thomas-Kilmann Model for Conflict Management
Based on two dimensions:
- **Assertiveness**: Attempting to satisfy one's own concerns
- **Cooperativeness**: Attempting to satisfy the other's concerns
Five approaches:
1. **Avoiding** (Low assertiveness, Low cooperation)
    - Short-term stress reduction but doesn't change the situation
    - Useful when: issue is trivial, information lacking, people need to cool down, opponent is very powerful
2. **Accommodating** (Low assertiveness, High cooperation)
    - Cooperating with the other party while not asserting one's own interests
    - Effective when: you are wrong, issue more important to other party, building goodwill
3. **Competing** (High assertiveness, Low cooperation)
    - Maximizes assertiveness, minimizes cooperation
    - Effective when: you have power, are sure of facts, situation is win-lose, no future interaction needed
4. **Compromise** (Moderate assertiveness, Moderate cooperation)
    - Not the most creative response to conflict
    - Not useful for conflicts from power asymmetry
    - Good for conflicts from scarce resources or as fallback position
5. **Collaborating** (High assertiveness, High cooperation)
    - Attempt to secure integrative agreement (win-win)
    - Works best when conflict not intense and each party has useful information
    - Takes time but enhances productivity
### Positive Aspects of Conflict
- Can be functional when promoting necessary organizational change by:
    - Consideration of new ideas
    - Monitoring other's performance more carefully
    - Signaling need for power redistribution
- Managers may sometimes stimulate conflict to cause change
### Conflict Debt
- Sum of unresolved issues that prevent moving forward
- Builds up due to:
    - Lack of skills to resolve conflict
    - Focus on being polite/pleasing
    - Lack of rewards for engaging in conflict
    - Catastrophizing conflict and conflating it with anger
## Stress
- **Stress**: The unconscious preparation to fight or flee when faced with any demand
- **Stressor**: The person or event that triggers the stress response
- **Stress Reactions**: Adverse psychological, physical, behavioral, and organizational consequences (**Physiological**, **Emotional**, **Behavioral**, **Psychological**)
### Stress and Performance
- **Yerkes-Dodson Law**: Performance increases with arousal to a point, then decreases; Optimal stress level exists for performance (neither too low nor too high, global max)
### Personality and Stress
Three key traits affecting stress perception and reactions:
1. **Locus of control**: Beliefs about factors controlling behavior
2. **Type A behavior pattern**: Aggressiveness, ambitiousness, competitiveness, hostility, impatience, urgency
3. **Negative affectivity**: Perceive more stressors, hypersensitive, gravitate to stressful jobs, use passive coping
### Stressors in Organizational Life
- **Executive/managerial stressors**: Role overload, heavy responsibility
- **Operative-level stressors**: Poor physical working conditions, poor job design
- **Boundary role stressors**: For those at organizational boundaries
### Job Demands-Resources Model
- **Job Demands**: Physical, psychological, social, or organizational features requiring sustained effort (Work overload, time pressure, role ambiguity, role conflict) when high -> burnout
- **Job Resources**: Features that help achieve goals, reduce demands, stimulate growth (Organization (pay), interpersonal relations, organization of work, task itself) when high -> engagement, buffer demand negatives
- Related to Engagement <> Burnout Spectrum
### Organizational Interventions for Stress
1. Reduce physical demands
2. Reduce task demands
3. Give greater worker control
4. Job-employee match in hiring & training
5. Clear communication of expectations
6. Fair treatment
7. Socio-emotional support
8. Instrumental support
9. Value work-life balance
10. Healthy change process
11. Help interpret events as opportunities
12. Recognize and deal with stress symptoms
# Week 11 (Power, Politics, Equity, Ethics)

## Power and Politics
- Power is the **capacity to influence others who are in a state of dependence**
- Not always perceived or exercised; Doesn't imply a poor relationship between holder & target
- Can flow in any direction in an organization; Applies to both individuals and groups
### Bases of Individual Power
1. **Legitimate Power**
    - Derived from a person's position/job
    - Formal authority and level in hierarchy
    - We are socialized to accept its influence
    - Response: Compliance
2. **Reward Power**
    - Derived from ability to provide positive and prevent negative outcomes
    - Anyone can use this through praising, complimenting, etc.
    - Response: Compliance
3. **Coercive Power**
    - Derived from use of punishment & threat
    - Generally ineffective & can provoke resistance
    - Response: Resistance
4. **Referent Power**
    - Derived from being well liked by others
    - Friendly interpersonal relations cause influence to go beyond organizational boundaries
    - Response: Commitment
5. **Expert Power**
    - Derived from having special information/expertise that is valued
    - Most consistently associated with employee effectiveness
    - Response: Commitment
### How People Obtain Power
1. **Doing the right things**: Activities lead to power when they are:
    - Extraordinary (excellent performance in unusual/non-routine activities)
    - Visible (activities must be seen by others)
    - Relevant (activities must matter to others)
2. **Cultivating the right people**: Developing relationships with:
    - Outsiders (key people outside the organization)
    - Subordinates (up-and-coming employees)
    - Peers (ensuring nothing blocks future power acquisition)
    - Superiors (the best way to obtain power through relationships)
### Empowerment
The process of giving employees authority, responsibility, and freedom to make decisions about their work. It involves:
- Distributing decision-making power throughout the organization
- Providing employees with resources, information, and support needed to be effective
- Creating conditions that foster intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy
- Removing barriers that limit employees' ability to perform effectively
### Need for Power (nPow in McClelland's w nAch, nAffiln)
- The need to have strong influence over others
- A reliable personality characteristic (some people have more than others)
- When responsible and controlled, negative properties are not observed
- Institutional managers (most effective) have high n Pow, use power for organizational goals

| **Positive Influence Tactics:**                                                                                                                                                                          | **Negative Influence Tactics:**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Pressure/Assertiveness<br>- Ingratiation<br>- Rationality<br>- Exchange<br>- Upward Appeal<br>- Coalition<br>- Consultation<br>- Inspirational Appeals<br>- Personal Appeals<br>- Legitimizing Tactics | - Blaming/attacking others<br>- Controlling access to information<br>- Avoiding, stalling<br>- Intimidation<br>- Taking credit for others' work<br>- Deceit<br>- Buffing<br>- Buck passing<br>- Over-conforming |
## Organizational Politics
- The pursuit of self-interest in an organization, whether or not this aligns with organizational goals
- Involves using means of influence or pursuing ends that organization doesn't sanction
- Self-conscious and intentional
- Can be individual or subunit activity
- Can have beneficial outcomes despite questionable tactics
- Networking may be involved and leveraged for power
### Political vs. Non-Political Behavior Matrix
|                       | **Sanctioned Means**                              | **Unsanctioned Means**                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sanctioned Ends**   | Nonpolitical Job Behavior                         | Political Behavior Potentially Functional to Organization |
| **Unsanctioned Ends** | Organizationally Dysfunctional Political Behavior | Organizationally Dysfunctional Political Behavior         |
### Political Skill
Ability to understand others at work and use that knowledge to influence them the following facets
1. **Social astuteness**: Being tuned into others' needs and motives
2. **Interpersonal influence**: Being convincing and adaptable
3. **Apparent sincerity**: Coming across as genuine with high integrity
4. **Networking ability**: Establishing good relations with key organizational members
### Networking
- Developing informal social contacts to enlist cooperation when needed
- Upper-level managers establish large political networks inside and outside the organization
- Aspects include: maintaining contacts, socializing, professional activities, community involvement, increasing internal visibility
- Research shows individuals with high self-esteem & extraversion network more
## Ethics
- **Ethics**: Moral principles governing behavior
- **Diversity**: Recognizing demographic and experiential heterogeneity
- **Equity**: Creating opportunities and removing barriers for marginalized groups
- **Inclusion**: Building a welcoming culture where people feel they belong
- Systematic thinking about the moral consequences of decisions
- Moral consequences framed in terms of potential harm to stakeholders
- Stakeholders: people inside or outside an organization potentially affected by decisions
### Causes of Unethical Behavior
- Gain
- Role conflict
- Strong organizational identification
- Competition
- Personality
- Organizational and industry culture
### Personality and Ethics
- Cynical people and those with external locus of control are less tuned to ethical matters
- High need for power may lead to unethical decisions
- People with strong economic values more likely to behave unethically
- Individual differences in moral reasoning sophistication
- Moral engagement associates with ethical behavior
### Characteristics of Ethical Managerial Behavior
1. **Ethical behavior**: Honesty and integrity in business dealings
2. **Social responsibility**: Economic fairness and social justice
3. **Environmental stewardship**: Environmental sustainability and quality of life
4. **Fair employment practices**: Equal opportunity, workplace safety, employee development
- Managers often face pressure to compromise their ethics, managers tend to view their own ethical standards as higher than those of their peers or sometimes even their superiors.
# Week 12/13 (Leadership)

## Leadership
- "the influence that particular individuals exert on the goal achievement of others in an organizational context"
- Effective leadership enhances productivity, innovation, satisfaction, and commitment
- Leadership requires: intention, followers, power, and an aim
- **Managers**: Uphold status quo, reactive, promote stability, implement vision, coordinate staff
- **Leaders**: Create new approaches, proactive, press for change, establish direction, inspire workers
## Trait Theory
- Focuses on personal qualities/traits of leaders
- Assumes leaders possess special traits distinguishing them from followers
- Key traits: Intelligence, energy/drive, self-confidence, dominance, motivation to lead, emotional stability, honesty/integrity, need for achievement, sociability
- Limitations:
    - Hard to determine if traits make the leader or opportunity produces traits
    - Doesn't tell us what leaders actually do
    - Doesn't account for situation/context
    - Doesn't necessarily lead to success
    - May perpetuate discrimination
## Situational/Contingency Theories
- Stress importance of context when examining leadership
- Types include:
#### **Fiedler Contingency** Model
- Matches leader style to appropriate situations

#### **House's Path-Goal** Theory
- Leader's job is to help employees achieve work and organizational goals
- Leader should:
    - Determine desired outcomes
    - Make outcomes contingent on performance
    - Inform employees of required performance
    - Clarify path to achieve goals
    - Remove performance barriers
- Four leadership styles:
    1. Directive: Informs expectations, gives guidance (for ambiguous tasks)
    2. Supportive: Friendly, approachable, shows concern (for stressful situations)
    3. Participative: Consults with subordinates (for buy-in, non-routine tasks)
    4. Achievement-oriented: Sets challenging goals, expects high performance (for those who like challenges)

#### **Hersey & Blanchard's** Situational Leadership Theory
- Adapts leadership style based on follower readiness

## Exchange Relationship-Based Theories
#### Transactional Leadership
- Based on exchange relationship with employees
- Leaders clarify link between goals and performance
- Uses rewards and reprimands
- Elements:
    - Contingent reward behavior
    - Management by exception (corrective action based on results)

#### Transformational Leadership
- Four dimensions:
    1. Charisma (Idealized Influence): Role model based on referent power
    2. Individualized Consideration: Caring about individual needs
    3. Inspirational Motivation: Articulating appealing vision
    4. Intellectual Stimulation: Challenging assumptions, fostering creativity
- Research shows:
    - Most consistent predictor of effective leadership
    - Positively related to firm performance
    - Effective during change
    - Develops high-quality relationships, identification, self-efficacy, value congruence
    - Best leaders are both transformational AND transactional

## Emerging Leadership Theories

#### Authentic Leadership
- Four behaviors:
    - Self-awareness: Understanding strengths/weaknesses and impact
    - Relational transparency: Presenting true self, sharing information
    - Balanced processing: Objective analysis before decisions
    - Internalized moral perspective: Values guide behavior
- Team leader authenticity relates to team member authenticity and productivity

#### Empowering Leadership
- Sharing power with employees
- Valuing participation and autonomy
- Two types:
    - Psychological Empowerment: Meaning, competence, self-determination, impact
    - Structural Empowerment: Resources, support, information, opportunity

#### Servant Leadership
- Serving others first, leading second
- Six characteristics:
    - Empowering and developing people
    - Humility
    - Authenticity
    - Interpersonal acceptance
    - Providing direction
    - Stewardship

#### Ethical Leadership
- Demonstrating appropriate conduct through personal actions and relationships
- Promoting conduct through communication, reinforcement, decision-making
- Significant influence on ethical culture
- Immediate supervisors have greatest effect
- Typical values: Integrity, altruism, humility, empathy, personal growth, authenticity, empowerment, fairness

## Dark Side of Leadership

#### Unethical Leadership
- Behaviors violating moral standards or promoting unethical conduct
- Typical vices: Self-serving, deception, hypocrisy, arrogance, lack of social inhibition, high self-monitoring, malevolence, masked intentions
#### Pseudo-Transformational Leadership
- Self-centered, manipulates followers for own goals
- Distorts the four dimensions of transformational leadership
#### Abusive Leadership
- "Sustained display of hostile behaviors, excluding physical contact"
- Rooted in power dynamics
- Often cyclical (previously abused become abusers)
- Targets vulnerable individuals

## Followers of Effective Leaders Show:
- Higher organizational commitment
- Greater job satisfaction
- Better satisfaction with supervisor
- More organizational citizenship behavior
- Higher work engagement
- More ethical behaviors


# Exam Case

![[Pasted image 20250409041348.png]]
### Q1 - Types of Conflict at Horizons Community Centre

The case presents multiple types of conflict:

1. **Task Conflict**:
    
    - Evidence: Disagreements over how to accomplish event tasks (Thomas's concern with permits vs. Creed's marketing strategy)
    - Resolution: Establish clear priorities, create a decision matrix for attractions, implement structured approval process
2. **Relationship Conflict**:
    
    - Evidence: Personal insults between team members, uncomfortable meetings
    - Resolution: Establish ground rules for communication, focus on issues not personalities, use a mediator
3. **Process Conflict**:
    
    - Evidence: Disagreement on timeline priorities (Emerie's focus on performer vs. Thomas's logistical concerns)
    - Resolution: Create a detailed timeline with dependencies, use project management techniques

### Q2 - Benefits of Conflict for Thomas

Thomas believes "Conflict only slows us down," but constructive conflict can:

- Reveal different perspectives that improve decision quality
- Identify potential issues before they become problems
- Stimulate innovation and creative solutions
- Build stronger team relationships through resolution

Thomas could use a **Collaborating** conflict mode instead of his apparent avoiding approach. This would involve:

- Working with Creed to find solutions that satisfy both marketing needs and logistical requirements
- Seeking common ground while addressing legitimate concerns from both sides
- Rationale: The festival's success requires both marketing appeal and operational functionality

### Q3 - Monica's Stress Using Job Demands-Resources Model

**Job Demands (high):**

- Time pressure ("two weeks until the event")
- Interpersonal conflict (team members arguing)
- Emotional demands (mediating conflicts)
- Workload ("working late nights")

**Job Resources (insufficient):**

- Limited social support (team in conflict)
- Lack of clear decision-making process
- Insufficient autonomy (caught between competing demands)

**Actions Monica's manager could take:**

1. Provide additional personnel resources to help with specific tasks
2. Establish clear decision-making authority and support her decisions
3. Offer coaching on conflict management techniques
4. Create structured meeting protocols to reduce interpersonal conflict

### Q1 - PasTech Inc. (Bases of Power)

**Octavia's current bases of power:**

1. **Legitimate power**: Octavia relies primarily on her formal authority as Team Lead, evident when she makes statements like "This is my call, and we need to move forward" and enforces decisions based on her position.
    
2. **Coercive power**: She uses close monitoring, demanding deadlines without consultation, and public criticism of team members, which are forms of punishment or threat.
    

**Why these are ineffective:**

- Legitimate power alone creates compliance but not commitment, especially when team members feel the promotion was unfair
- Relying on authority without technical leadership creates resentment
- Public criticism damages team morale and engagement
- Rigid directives without collaboration prevents team input and ownership
- Her approach has directly contributed to missed deadlines and poor results

**Alternative base of power:**

**Expert power** would be more effective because:

- Octavia is described as "excelling technically," so she has the foundation
- By demonstrating her expertise rather than just her authority, she could gain respect from Dorian and Selina
- Expert power creates influence through knowledge and competence, which resonates in technical teams
- It would allow her to lead by example rather than directive
- It shifts focus from position politics to problem-solving and performance
- It can reduce the perceived unfairness of her promotion if team sees her technical merit

To implement expert power, Octavia should:

- Lead collaborative problem-solving sessions where she can demonstrate her technical skills
- Mentor team members and share her knowledge rather than just giving orders
- Seek team input on technical decisions to leverage collective expertise
- Acknowledge the expertise of Dorian and Selina in their respective areas

### Q2 - PasTech Inc. (Influence Tactics and Political Skill)

**Negative influence tactics used:**

**Dorian's tactics:**

- **Undermining**: Spreading rumors that Octavia's promotion was due to favoritism rather than merit
- **Taking credit for others' work**: Presenting team achievements as his own during client presentations
- **Shifting blame**: Leaving Octavia to address errors after presentations

**Selina's tactics:**

- **Information manipulation**: Withholding critical project updates until deadlines are imminent
- **Sabotage**: Forcing Octavia to make rushed decisions with incomplete information
- **Reputation damage**: Hinting at Octavia's perceived shortcomings to upper management

**Two actions to improve political skill:**

1. **Develop social astuteness**: Both Dorian and Selina should focus on understanding the needs and goals of the entire team, including Octavia. Rather than undermining leadership, they should identify how they can contribute positively to team success in ways that also advance their own career goals. This includes:
    
    - Reading the work environment more accurately
    - Understanding the bigger organizational context following the merger
    - Recognizing how their negative behaviors impact everyone's perception of them
    - Identifying constructive ways to demonstrate their value to upper management
2. **Practice apparent sincerity**: Both should work on presenting themselves as having genuine and honest intentions. Currently, their behaviors appear calculated and self-serving, which damages trust. They should:
    
    - Communicate openly about concerns rather than acting covertly
    - Express authentic commitment to team goals
    - Align words with actions by supporting team efforts publicly
    - Build genuine connections with team members including Octavia
    - Be transparent about their career aspirations while supporting current leadership

### Q3 - PasTech Inc. (Ethics in Managerial Behavior)

**Two specific actions for Octavia to improve team dynamics:**

1. **Implement procedural justice through inclusive decision-making**:
    
    - Create structured opportunities for team input before making decisions
    - Establish clear criteria for how decisions will be made and communicate them transparently
    - Institute regular team meetings where all members can voice concerns and suggest improvements
    - Document and acknowledge all team members' contributions
    - Develop a fair system for distributing project tasks and recognition that values each team member's strengths
    
    This addresses the ethical principles of fairness and respect, showing team members that their input is valued even when she makes the final decision. It counters her current approach of shutting down discussions and not consulting the team.
    
2. **Practice ethical leadership through feedback and development conversations**:
    
    - Schedule individual meetings with Dorian and Selina to acknowledge their expertise and experience
    - Listen to their career aspirations and create development plans
    - Replace public criticism with private, constructive feedback
    - Acknowledge her own leadership learning curve and ask for their input on how the team can function better
    - Model ethical behavior by taking accountability for team failures rather than blaming individuals
    - Create mentoring opportunities for senior team members to showcase their expertise

Jeff Polson is the COO of a FinanceTime, a fin-tech company based in Toronto with 500 employees in

2023. FinanceTime has grown significantly in the last 2 years.

In January 2022, FinanceTime had 70 employees with one office location. Later that year, it acquired

another fin-tech company, CashFit, with 50 employees. Once the merger was completed and skills were

assessed, FinanceTime made the decision to terminate 20 employees, all of whom had previously worked

at CashFit. This was due to redundancies and overlap in terms of skill sets.

In 2023, FinanceTime made the decision to acquire another, larger organization, ProfitTech, a software

development company with 400 employees. It has kept all of these employees thus far and is now an

enterprise of 500 people.

37EXAM PREP

Today, FinanceTime is struggling to bring together the organization and its leaders. While it recognized

that the cultures of FinanceTime, CashFit and ProfitTech were quite different, the transition to create a

strong new culture has been more challenging than expected. Jeff was initially quite optimistic about this

transition but lately his executive team has displayed some concerning behaviours including outbursts at

executive meetings; leaders focused inward on their teams needs; and, lack of information sharing among

leaders. One executive recently said: “Why did we even merge in the first place? We were all doing fine

on our own before this change.”

38EXAM PREP

Given the challenges noted above, Jeff has been reflecting on what he and his colleagues could have done

differently. “I thought we did everything right. I mean, we knew we had to acquire other firms in order to

grow - we just could not keep up with client demands. And, once we realized this, I thought we got a lot of

folks involved in our planning process. Our new organizational structure was well-thought out and we

communicated it, along with our new vision and goals, months before the change. But, for some reason,

folks aren’t accepting our new reality. We are struggling to be successful and we need to evaluate how we

are doing.”

Additionally, employees are growing dissatisfied and FinanceTime is worried about losing some of its top

talent. Three high potential employees recently approached Jeff and advised that they had other offers

from competitors. “We love it here, Jeff, but FinanceTime needs to improve its compensation. We are

willing to consider staying, but we need to renegotiate our compensation”

39EXAM PREP

1. Considering concepts related to organizational change, offer one way to explain the overall attitude of

the executive team (based on observed behaviours)?

2. Use Lewin’s 3-step change model to explain the stages that FinanceTime experienced. What was

executed well? What was not?

3. What, in addition to salary, should these employees consider in their negotiation? Consider 3 additional

items. What steps should employees take to plan for the salary negotiation?
