# Positive/Negative Reinforcement
- Effectiveness Contingent on [[Personality]]

## Positive
➢The application or addition (+) of a  
stimulus that increases or maintains  
the probability of some behaviour.  
➢The stimulus is the positive reinforcer.  
➢The reinforcer is dependent or  
contingent on the occurrence of some  
desired behaviour.

## Negative
➢The removal (-) of a stimulus from a  
situation that increases or maintains  
the probability of some behaviour.  
➢Negative reinforcement occurs when  
a response prevents some event or  
stimulus from occurring.  
➢The removed or prevented stimulus  
is a negative reinforcer.
