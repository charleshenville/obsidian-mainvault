# Of $f(x,y)|_{(a,b)}$ is defined by $span(T_x,T_y)$ and the [[Partial Derivative]]s of $f$
$$T_x=(1,0,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b))$$
$$T_y=(0,1,\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b))$$
We can get the equation of this plane by computing the normal vector to it and shifting it so it passes over the point:
$$(a,b,f(a,b))$$
Thus the equation for one is as follows:
$$z=f(a,b)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b)(x-a)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b)(y-b)$$
