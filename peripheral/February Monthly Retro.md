# What went well
- Great communication in the goals and scope of the projects/deliverables (better than Jan)
- We took some time to explore all options which is good (eg 4K4D vs 3DGS per Time step)
- Productive meetings and 1-on-1s, I feel like we have a very good balance of meetings to engineering time rn.

# What could have been better
- We may have taken too long to pivot away from something like 4K4D which is not gaussian based
- Clearer outline of priorities would be nice going forward although it has been relatively good so far
